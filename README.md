Problem Statement:

One of the major concerns we look forward to answer through our visualization is related to
Candy Production. By understanding the patterns and trends in Candy consumption, we can
support candy manufacturing executives make decisions for expanding their operations. This
helps candy manufacturers observe states that their products are popular and ramp up
production. By identifying the most popular candies in a particular state, the wholesale and retail
seller can decide on their orders. Understanding the contents/ingredients involved in the most
popular candies, the manufacturing executives can design new products which might have
higher success rates.
Our visualization also aids candy consumers to choose the best candies when organizing an
event. Knowing the preferred ingredients of the audience can help the organizers eliminate risks
of wastage. Identifying ingredients that they are known to be allergic in certain candies can help
find alternatives. Understanding the sugar content of each helps to provide replacements which
are organic or sugar-free for the consumers who are having dietary concerns, within the budget
of the organizers.
